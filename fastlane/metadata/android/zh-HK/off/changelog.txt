新鮮事
==================
一、 You get the 360 picture: nutrition, ingredients, and all food facts, neatly and clearly presented.
二、 Get the "NutriScore" nutrition grade for all products in the world. Easily compare products. Easier than deciphering nutrition tables.
三、 Get extra information from Wikipedia. Click on a food category, an additive… to learn more and see similar products.
四、 You can set allergens alerts (always double check the actual label yourself though!)
五、 You now get a scan history you can export and that never leaves your phone
六、 You can shake your phone at any time in the app to start scanning
七、 You can now add new products even when you're offline
八、 You can now help complete your favorite foods directly from the app: take photos, fill info, make food transparency happen
九、 Everything is also much faster. Products load blazingly fast, even with a bad mobile connection.
十、 我們對您的個人資料依然不感興趣。 您不用註冊都可以掃描和貢獻食品資料。
額外功能！ Despite all the new stuff, the app is as light as before. 手機的剩餘空間是寶貴的。
